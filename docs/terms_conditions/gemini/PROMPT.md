**Role:** You are a dual-qualified legal expert in Dutch Contract Law (Burgerlijk Wetboek) and International ICT Law, specializing in ZZP (Freelance) compliance for 2026.

**Objective:** Draft a comprehensive set of General Terms and Conditions (Algemene Voorwaarden) for **Scuttle Development** (KvK 96040947), based in Eindhoven, Netherlands.

**Core Requirements:**

1. **Legal Basis & Independence:** The document must align with the **Modelovereenkomst ICT Professional (9052021540810)**. Explicitly state that the Contractor operates with full professional independence, without a relationship of authority ("gezag"), and is responsible for their own tools and timing to prevent "schijnzelfstandigheid."
2. **AI Usage & Disclosure:**
* Explicitly state that the Developer uses AI-assisted tools (e.g., Cursor, GitHub Copilot, LLMs) for efficiency.
* Warrant that all AI-generated code is subject to human review and testing.
* Guarantee that no Client Confidential Information or PII is used to train public AI models (Zero Data Retention / Enterprise-grade privacy only).


3. **EU AI Act Compliance (2026):** Include a clause regarding the "Acceptable Use" of deliverables. If the software includes AI features, the Client must comply with the EU AI Act and the underlying provider's (OpenAI/Anthropic) policies.
4. **Intellectual Property (IP):** IP rights only transfer to the Client upon **100% full payment** of all invoices related to the project. Include a license for the Developer to reuse non-proprietary "building blocks" and snippets.
5. **Liability (The Shield):**
* Limit liability to the amount paid for the specific project.
* Exclude liability for indirect damages, loss of profit, or "AI hallucinations" provided industry-standard testing was performed.
* Exclude liability for third-party service failures (hosting, API outages).


6. **Payment & Acceptance:** Define a strict 7-day window for "Acceptance Testing." If the client doesn't provide feedback within 7 days, the work is deemed accepted and the final invoice is due.
7. **NDA Integration:** Reference that all work is subject to a mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement, with a fixed penalty of €5,000 per violation.

**Output Structure:**

* **Version A:** Professional Dutch (Juridisch Nederlands).
* **Version B:** Professional English (International Business English).
* **Formatting:** Use clear, numbered articles. Ensure the company name "Scuttle Development" is used consistently and correctly.

# **The "Scuttle Shield" NDA Generator Prompt**

**Objective:** Draft a comprehensive, mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) between **Scuttle Development** (KvK 96040947, Eindhoven) and a potential **Client**.

**Key Requirements & "Ruthless" Clauses:**

1. **Expansive Definition of Confidential Information:**
* Explicitly include: Source code, database schemas, API keys, product roadmaps, and business strategies.
* **Crucial Add-on:** Include "Prompt Engineering Strategies," "Custom AI Workflows," and "Internal LLM fine-tuning data" as protected trade secrets.


2. **The "AI Vault" Clause:**
* Neither party may input the other party’s Confidential Information into any public Artificial Intelligence model or tool (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude) unless that tool is explicitly configured for **"Zero Data Retention" (ZDR)** or is an enterprise version that guarantees the data is not used for model training.


3. **Strict Use Limitation:**
* Confidential information may only be used for the specific purpose of the project evaluation or execution. Any other use is a material breach.


4. **Penalty Clause (The "Bite"):**
* Under Dutch law, proving "damages" is difficult. You MUST include a **fixed penalty clause (boetebeding)**.
* Draft a clause stating that any breach of this NDA results in an immediate, non-reducible penalty of **€5,000 per violation**, plus **€500 for every day the violation continues**, without prejudice to the right to claim full damages if they exceed this amount.


5. **Term & Survival:**
* The obligation of confidentiality must survive the termination of the working relationship for a period of **5 years**.


6. **Return or Destruction:**
* Upon request or termination, the receiving party must destroy all digital copies and provide a written certificate of destruction within 3 business days.

**Tone & Output:**

* Produce two versions: **Professional Dutch** and **International English**.
* Use a "No-Nonsense" legal tone.
* Ensure the formatting includes clear signatory blocks for both parties.

   the new one                                                              

● Let me find where the founder image is currently referenced in the codebase.

● Searched for 2 patterns (ctrl+o to expand)

● I can see founder_portrait.png is the current image. Let me check how it's
  referenced.

❯ check if the site looks correct in the browser 

● Claude in Chrome[tabs_context]
  ⎿  Error: No Chrome extension connected.

● I can't check the site in the browser — no Chrome extension is connected. You
  can either:

  1. Connect the Chrome extension and I'll visually inspect the site for you
  2. Check it yourself at your GitHub Pages URL

  Would you like to try connecting the browser, or is there another way I can
  help verify?

❯ try connecting the browser 
  ⎿  Error: No other browsers available to switch to. Open Chrome with the 
     Claude extension in another browser to switch.

● No Chrome browsers with the Claude extension are available. To connect:

  1. Open Google Chrome
  2. Install the Claude in Chrome extension if you haven't already
  3. Click the extension icon and hit Connect

  Then I'll be able to visually inspect the site for you. Let me know once it's
  ready.

❯ try connecting the browser 
  ⎿  Error: No other browsers available to switch to. Open Chrome with the 
     Claude extension in another browser to switch.

● Still no Chrome browser available to connect to. Make sure:

  1. Chrome is open with the Claude in Chrome extension installed
  2. The extension is active (click its icon in the toolbar)
  3. Click Connect in the extension popup

  Once you've done that, let me know and I'll try again.

❯ try connecting the browser 
  ⎿  Error: No other browsers available to switch to. Open Chrome with the 
     Claude extension in another browser to switch.

● Still unable to connect — no Chrome browser with the extension is responding.
  I've tried 3 times now without success.

  Would you like to:
  - Try again later once you've set up the Chrome extension
  - Preview locally by running npm run dev and checking it yourself
  - Skip the visual check — the build passed and deployment succeeded, so the
  site should be working correctly
